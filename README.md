# Portfolio
This portfolio is designed to showcase some of my work. It is written with HTML and CSS, also utilizing Bootstrap for the nav-bar.

# Challenges with project

One problem I encountered early on was with the portfolioContainer in the portfolio.html document. The issue was with the nav-bar on certain screen widths. When the nav would expand downward over the portfolioContainer, it would go underneath. The issue was with the z-index of each, which had to be adjusted accordingly so the nav-bar would expand over the portfolioContainer.

# Finishing Notes

Future plans for this project are to change what is on display in the portfolio.html and possibly make the styling for the pages more robust.
